Created a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework for categorizing emotions into seven distinct classes. Achieved an
impressive 82% accuracy in emotion recognition, underscoring the robustness and reliability of the system. Utilized proficiency in
machine learning, encompassing CNN architecture crafting, data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation, to successfully
meet project goals
